Generic implementation of backpropogation algorithm in Java

Idea of neural networks with multiple hidden layers with multiple nodes is implemented.
Implemenation involves two parts

Data Preprocseesing
Back Propogation algorithm

In Preprocessing numerical fields are normalised with its standard deviation and texual fields are converted into numerical values. 
Back propogation is done either untill the error tolerance is met or is stopped after a constant number of times.
