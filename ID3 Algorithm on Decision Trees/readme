Java implementation of classification using ID3 algorithm on decision trees : 

Assumptions
•	There will be no missing data or attributes.
•	The data used to test the implementation contains only Boolean attributes or Boolean classes.
•	The first row of the data set contains column names and each non-blank contains a new data instance.
•	The last column contains the Class Labels.
•	Model is build using training dataset, validated on validation dataset, tested on test dataset.
•	If there is a blank line, the program will skip it.
•	Entropy uses logarithm of base2.
•	The pruning factor is multiplied by total number of nodes to give the result of the number of nodes to be pruned. (as given in the assignment description)
•	The pruning factor is taken dynamically from the command line and should be between 0 and 1 (exclusive) because if it is zero, no nodes are pruned and if 1 all nodes are pruned. 
•	If a leaf node is reached that contains no pure data, we are free to label it.

Program Description 
The tree classifier is based on ID3 algorithm.
The program reads four command line arguments 
•	Training dataset
•	Validation dataset
•	Test dataset
•	Pruning Factor 
The program outputs the tree and a report on the accuracy before and after pruning data.
